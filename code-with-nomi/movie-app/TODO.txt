TODO

1. add the lists to HomeScreen:
    1.1 Movies -> Popular
    1.2 Movies -> Now Playing

2. Add cached values for the Lists. Since they are updated once a day there is
no need to fetch them every time.

3. Later look for cache for other resources too. Like last person clicked, last
search made (offer to see last search button on SearchScreen), last movie clicked

4. Test if the cache is being invalidated correctly and test if the list are using
the cache and not fetching the API every time

5. Add support for languages

6. Add login with tmdb user

7. Add footer for TMDB API credits and Dev name
